Dalgona Coffee
(So fluffy. So creamy.)

INGREDIENTS:
    1. 2 tbsp. granulated sugar
    2. 2 tbsp. instant coffee 
    3. 2 tbsp. cold water
    4. Ice, for serving
    5. Milk, for serving

DIRECTIONS:

    1. In a medium bowl, combine sugar, coffee, and water. 
        Using a hand mixer or a whisk, vigorously whisk until mixture turns silky smooth and shiny, 
        then continue whisking until it thickens and holds its lofty, foamy shape. 
        (If whisking by hand, it will take 8 to 12 minutes to get to optimal fluffiness.)
    2. Fill a glass most of the way full with ice and milk, then dollop and swirl the whipped coffee mixture on top, 
        mixing before drinking, if desired.
