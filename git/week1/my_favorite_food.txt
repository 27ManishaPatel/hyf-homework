Vanilla Cupcakes

Ingredients for Vanilla Cupcakes:

This recipe makes exactly 12 cupcakes and requires simple ingredients: 
all-purpose flour, 
butter, 
sugar, 
eggs, 
buttermilk, 
baking powder, 
salt and vanilla. 

The combination of softened butter and buttermilk creates an amazingly soft cupcake crumb that just melts in your mouth. 
Also, if you haven’t tried our (2-ingredient) Homemade Vanilla Extract, it will take your baked goods to the next level.

Method:

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, and salt.
2. In a second bowl (or bowl of your stand mixer), beat together softened butter and sugar on medium-high speed 5 minutes until thick and fluffy.
3. Beat in eggs 1 at a time, mixing to incorporate with each egg then blend in vanilla and scrape down the bowl.
4. Reduce mixer to medium speed and add the flour in thirds, alternating with adding the 1/2 cup buttermilk and beating well between additions.
5. Pour batter into 12 lined muffin tins, filling 2/3 full. Bake in the center of the oven at 350˚F for 20-23 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. 
    Let cool 5 minutes in the pan then remove cupcakes to a wire rack to cool completely.
